## Problem Overview

[Knapsack Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem):

Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

In other words, given two integer arrays `val[0..n-1]` and `wt[0..n-1]`, which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively, and given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of `val[]` such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

## Analysis

Find the breakeven point for the other methods over the naive approach.
